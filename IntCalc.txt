This is an infix calculator that only works on integers.
It understands:
	+ Addition
		Is absolute value when used as a unary operator.
	- Subtraction
		Is negation when used as a unary operator.
	* Multiplication
	/ Division
	% Modulo
		Division and Modulo work according to the mathematical
		definition of the division algorithm: the remainder is
		always positive.
	^ Exponentiation
	! Factorial
	P Permutation
	C Combination
	N Minimum
	M Maximum
	G Greatest Common Factor (Divisor)
	L Least Common Multiple (Denominator)
		The six functions above are treated as infix operators
		by the calculator.
	I Modular Inverse
	S Square Root (Truncated, prefix "operator")
	F Fibbonacci Number (postfix, like '!')

Parenthesis can be used to any level of nesting and can be mixed with brackets
and braces, but the program doesn't distinguish between the three when
reporting errors.

Use ';' to end a calculation, as white space is ignored. Numbers can contain
spaces and newlines, which makes inputting large numbers easier.

Use '@' to represent the value of the previous calculation.

EOF exits (Ctrl-Z on Windows, Crtl-D on Linux and Unix-based Mac).

This calculator works in bases other than 10 as a command line option:
	IntCalc [ output_base [ input_base ] ]
Note that to get an input base other than 10, one must also specify an output
base. Valid bases are 2 to 36. The characters 'a-z' (lower case) are used as
the extra digits in these higher bases. When inputting a number, the parser
will convert digits >= the current input base to the maximum of the current
input base, i.e. "1100ahello" is read as 1100999999 if the input base is 10.
